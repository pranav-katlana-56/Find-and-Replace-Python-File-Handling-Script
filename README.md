This is a automation python script for Practise purpose
This Script basically used to replace the words in text document with new given word
Inorder to use it properly you need to follow some Guidelines, but before that lets see how it works
So my script takes three input from user while it is runned:
  First Input = Name of Text file (It works on text file only and while entering file name dont forget to use file extention like ".txt" ,however you can fix it in the       script if you have only one type of extention for text file in your pc
  Second Input = The word which need to be replaced
  Third Input = New word from which previous word will be replaced
 
After Entering all the inputs my script will create a new file with name "result.txt" with replaced words in the same directory where your'e running the script
Note:
  Run the script in same directory where you have your text File
